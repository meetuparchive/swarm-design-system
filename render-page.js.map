Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm A fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `ENTERING`\n *  - `ENTERED`\n *  - `EXITING`\n *  - `EXITED`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Keep it casual and natural—if you wouldn’t say it to a friend, then just don’t say it that way. Write with a glimmer behind your eye.</p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> You’re in. We’re excited to have you on board.<br/>\\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Success!

Everything will eventually need to be localized.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Our voice is welcoming and helpful</h2>\\n<p>When we’re inclusive and inviting, our members and organizers feel comfortable to be themselves. Write as if you’re the host of an intimate dinner party. Try to be helpful, moving people forward through the experience, creating no dead ends.</p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> It won’t be the same here without you<br/>\\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Are you sure you want to unsubscribe?</p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Keep your title under 65 characters<br/>\\n<strong>DO NOT</strong> Oops!

Colons always have one space after them when used in the context of a sentence and no space when used with numbers, such as times or ratios. If the post-colon phrase is a complete sentence, the first letter following the colon should be capitalized. If it’s not, lowercase. </p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> Update: Your Meetup location changed<br/>\\n<strong>DON’T</strong> Update: your Meetup location changed</p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> There’s one person that can answer that question: your organizer.<br/>\\n<strong>DON’T</strong> There’s one person that can answer that questions: Your organizer. </p>\\n<h3>Dashes</h3>\\n<p>We only use hyphens for compound modifiers and phone numbers. We use em dashes with no spaces on each side for punctuating prose—like this. As for en dashes, we use them as a replacement for the word to, for example: 9am–6pm or Monday–Friday.</p>\\n<p><strong>DO</strong> It’s like Facebook groups—only better<br/>\\n<strong>DON’T</strong>

Provide other visual cues to communicate important states; elements like text, stroke, or icons can be helpful here.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/a11y/a11y_dontRelyOnColorAlone.png\\\" alt=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on color as the only communication tool\\\" title=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on color as the only communication tool\\\"></p>\\n<p>Our minimum text contrast ratio is 3:1. The WCAG guidelines require contrast ratio between text and background to be at least 4.5:1 for normal-sized text and 3:1 for large text for an AA rating. <strong>Tip:</strong> When designing, pretend you'll be showing it on a projector or crappy TV. That's closer to what users with vision impairments or even just lower quality monitors will experience.</p>\\n<p>Important icons text should follow our contrast guidelines, but decorative elements or \\\"nice-to-know\\\" text can bend the rules a bit.</p>\\n<h4>Color testing tools:</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.getstark.co/\\\">Stark</a> - Sketch plugin for testing for contrast ratios and simulating color blindness</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/\\\">Contrast ratio checker</a> - Simply checks for contrast ratio between two colors</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/\\\">Contrast finder</a> - checks contrast ratio and recommends accessible colors if your color combo fails</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://material.io/color/#!/?view.left=0&#x26;view.right=0\\\">Color Tool (by Google)</a> - Check for accessibility in color combos or small color pallettes</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://hexnaw.com/\\\">Hex Naw</a> - Can test full color pallettes and identify accessible and inaccessible combos</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://usecontrast.com/\\\">Contrast</a> - macOS app</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Touch targets</h3>\\n<p>Touch targets should be at least 40px. This translates to a physical size of about 7mm, regardless of screen resolution.\\nTouch targets should be spaced at least 8px to ensure balanced information density and avoid accidental taps on adjacent touch targets.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/a11y/a11y_makeTargetsTappable.png\\\" alt=\\\"Make tap targets tappable\\\" title=\\\"Make tap targets tappable\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Hierarchy and focus</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Lay out content according to it's relative level of importance</li>\\n<li>Place important actions at the most easily reached parts of the screen, which is typically at the edges and at the top or bottom of the viewport.</li>\\n<li>Try to group related items together</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Focus order</h4>\\n<p>Users who use keyboard navigation or assistive technology will depend on a logical focus order. Input focus should follow the visual order of the layout, from the top to the bottom of the screen. If you design with a clear hierarchy, a predictable and sensible focus order should happen almost automatically.</p>\\n<p>Try this out by going to Facebook or Google's search results page and navigate using your tab keys, arrows, and enter keys.</p>\\n<h3>Avoid hiding content or controls</h3>\\n<p>Instead of hiding actions and information behind hover states, explore more inclusive alternatives.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Place secondary actions inside of menus (or non-modal dialogs), without using hover states to hide the trigger.</li>\\n<li>Lighten the contrast of secondary icons and darken them on hover.</li>\\n<li>Use tangible items as triggers for larger hovers. An info icon is a better trigger than white space to launch a content-filled hover.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Experiencing Meetup using assistive technology</h3>\\n<h4>Keyboard navigation</h4>\\n<p>Consider <code>:focus</code> styles. The tab key navigates through various interactive elements on a page. A default visual indicator is provided by the web browser - usually a blue shadow or outline. When an element is in focus, it can be further activated using the keyboard.\\nSome examples of <code>:focus</code> styles can be seen in our <code>Button</code> component, <code>Dropdown</code> component, and all of our form components.</p>\\n<h4>User-scaled text</h4>\\n<p>Consider how your design looks when a user scales text using their browser or their device accessibility settings. Don't stress too much about this, just keep it in mind.</p>\\n<h3>Forms</h3>\\n<p>Text inputs should have clearly defined boundaries - for example: a border, a background color, etc</p>\\n<p>Don't rely on placeholder text as Make sure inputs are clearly labeled. In the rare case you have a field or set of fields that doesn't work with a visual label, at least come up with a label for screen readers to use.\\n<img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/forms/forms_noPlaceholderAsLabel.png\\\" alt=\\\"Don&#x27;t use placeholder as label example\\\" title=\\\"Don&#x27;t use placeholder as label example\\\"></p>\\n<p>Avoid relying on color alone to indicate errors\\n<img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/a11y/a11y_clearlyIndicateErrors.png\\\" alt=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on color to indicate errors\\\" title=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on color to indicate errors\\\"></p>\\n<p>For more information about designing forms for Meetup, see the <a href=\\\"./forms.html\\\">Forms</a> guidelines.</p>\\n<h3>Charts and Graphs</h3>\\n<p>Charts, and graphs are visual representations of complex data. However, since they are images, these provide serious accessibility issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. Alternate methods of display must be provided to these users.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For data in charts and graphs a text description of the data contained within must be provided</li>\\n<li>For color-coded charts, supplement colors with texture to provide enough contrast for colorblind users to distinguish\\ndifferences in areas.</li>\\n<li>A good method for complex charts is to provide the data in a tabular format allowing users to toggle between the various representations of the data presented.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr>\\n<h4>Sources and additional resources:</h4>\\n<p><a

It's best to design the component so that each piece of information is self-contained and can be understood no matter what order they appear in.\\n<img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/i18n/i18n_noSentenceInterfaces.png\\\" alt=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on word order\\\" title=\\\"Don&#x27;t rely on word order\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Avoid making components that contain text a fixed-width. This prevents them from growing or shrinking to support translations of different lengths.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Wrapping text in components is preferred to truncating the text. You may be cutting off important information in another language.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Don't put text inside of a graphic, it can't be translated</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For reference, here's a chart of text expansion rate from <a href=\\\"http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/guidelines/a3.html\\\">IBM's globalization guidelines</a>:\\n<img src=\\\"/assets/contentImages/dosAndDonts/i18n/i18n_IBMExpansionRateChart.png\\\" alt=\\\"Chart: IBM&#x27;s word text expansion rate\\\" title=\\\"Chart: IBM&#x27;s word text expansion rate\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Rethinking our NYC-based biases</h3>\\n<p>Many of Meetup's employees live near Meetup HQ in NYC.
